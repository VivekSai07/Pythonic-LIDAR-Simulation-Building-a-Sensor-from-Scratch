# Understanding the Functionality of LIDAR Sensor
LIDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that utilizes light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances to the Earth. It operates on the principle of measuring the time it takes for a laser pulse to travel to an object or surface and return to the sensor. This technology is widely used in various fields such as surveying, geology, autonomous vehicles, and archaeology due to its high precision and accuracy.

## Basic Components:
- **Laser Emitter**: The LIDAR sensor emits short pulses of laser light towards the target area. These pulses are typically in the form of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye but easily detectable by the sensor.
- **Scanner**: The scanner directs the emitted laser pulses over the desired area. It can be either a rotating mirror or a stationary multi-beam setup, depending on the specific LIDAR design.
- **Receiver**: After the laser pulse interacts with objects in the target area, a portion of the light is reflected back towards the sensor. The receiver collects these returning light pulses.
- **Timing and Distance Measurement System**: By precisely measuring the time it takes for the laser pulses to travel to the object and back, the LIDAR system calculates the distance to each point in the scanned area.
